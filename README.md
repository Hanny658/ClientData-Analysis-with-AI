# Analytic Skills with General Process

## The General Process of Doing Churn Analysis

1. **Data Collection**:
   Gather customer-related data, like demographics, usage statistics, interaction at customer service, etc.

2. **Data Preparation** (or so-called Data Cleaning in DA terms):
   Before making raw data usable, handle missing values, correct possible errors, and format it to be suitable for analysis (so-called Data Normalization). Sometimes creating a customer profile for each individual in the dataset would be useful here (for individual customer journey, including things like purchasing patterns, preferences, engagement history... and also helpful for further improvements like service personalization).

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   Select or develop new data features that could help in predicting churn, such as the frequency of product usage, changes in purchasing patterns, or the number of customer support tickets raised.

4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to detect and understand the data's underlying patterns, detect outliers, and identify trends. When Customer Segmentation has been done, this could include analyzing the churn rate across different customer segments.

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   Build a predictive model (with statistical or machine learning techniques) to forecast which customers are most likely to churn. Commonly used algorithms are logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.

7. **Implementation**:
   Analyze the model's results to identify the key factors (features) contributing to customer churn, then devise targeted interventions aimed at retaining customers and put it into action! ~~(handover to those sales and customer service people)~~

8. **Monitoring and Refinement**:
   Continuously monitor the impact of the retaining strategies on the churn rate and refine the approaches as necessary based on its performance and changing market conditions.


## Customer Segmentation Process

> Customer segmentation divides our customers into groups that share similar characteristics, making it easier to target marketing efforts and product development effectively. Here's the general process for conducting customer segmentation:

1. **Define Objectives**:
   Clearly define what we aim to achieve with segmentation.

2. **Data Processing**:
   Combined data collecting, cleaning, and EDA as they are general ways to deal with raw data. For customer segmentation, data collected would still be focused on demographics, purchasing behavior, customer interaction data, etc. If we conduct this before churn analysis, we could reuse the same dataset from customer segmentation for churn analysis.

3. **Choosing Segmentation Method**:
   Decide on the segmentation method or combination of methods to use based on our needs. Common methods include:
   - **Demographic Segmentation**: Based on age, gender, income, education, etc.
   - **Geographic Segmentation**: Based on location such as country, region, city, or neighborhood.
   - **Psychographic Segmentation**: Based on lifestyles, interests, attitudes, values.
   - **Behavioral Segmentation**: Based on purchasing behavior, user status, loyalty, and engagement levels.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   Use various statistical techniques and algorithms to further segment the customer base. Examples include:
   - **Clustering**: A statistical method that divides customers into different groups or clusters based on similarity of responses to various variables.
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of the data, simplifying the analysis while retaining trends and patterns.
   - **Factor Analysis**: Identifies underlying variables, or factors, that explain the pattern of correlations within a set of observed variables.

5. **Segment Profiling**:
   Once segments are defined, profile each segment to understand its distinctive characteristics and behaviors. This helps in tailoring marketing messages and offers to each segment.

6. **Develop Strategies / Implement / Monitor and Refine**:
   Design different marketing strategies for different segments of customers and put them into action. Continuously monitor and update strategies as needed.


## Content Analysis Process

> Content analysis can be used in various aspects. Here are some of the most common ways it has been used, so you can decide which one(s) meets our requirements:

1. **Themes and Messages**: Identifying the central themes and messages conveyed in marketing content.
2. **Brand Consistency**: Evaluating how well the content aligns with the brand's image, values, and overall marketing goals.
3. **Customer Engagement**: Assessing content based on how it engages the target audience.
4. **Competitor Comparison**: Comparing content against competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, and differentiators.
5. **Media Effectiveness**: Analyzing which types of content (videos, blogs, infographics, social media posts, etc.) perform best in terms of audience reach, engagement, and conversion rates.
6. **SEO and Keywords**: Reviewing the presence and impact of keywords and SEO strategies within the content.
7. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using automated tools (NLP) to detect the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the content.
8. **Visual Analysis**: For content that includes visual elements (like images, videos, and infographics), analyzing the effectiveness of these visuals in conveying messages and engaging users.
9. **User Feedback**: Incorporating analysis of comments, reviews, and other forms of user feedback to gauge public reaction and refine future content.
10. **... more to come up with**

### General Process

1. **Define Objectives**: (as usual, most important)

2. **Gather Content / Collect Data**:
   - Collect the content to be analyzed. This could include social media posts, blog articles, marketing emails, videos, or any other relevant marketing materials.

3. **Categorize Content**:
   - Create a framework for categorizing the information. Define categories (based on themes, message tone, visual elements, user interactions, etc.), or find open-source ones online. Then apply it to the content we gathered.

4. **Analyze and Interpret Data**:
   - Analyze the categorized data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.

5. **Evaluate Against Objectives**:
   - Compare the findings against the objectives we defined. Assess how well the content is performing in terms of engagement, SEO effectiveness, sentiment, etc.

6. **Report Findings**:
   - Prepare a report or presentation (any kind of reporting method) that summarizes the insights gained from the content analysis. (Best to have actionable recommendations based on the findings)

7. **Implement Changes**:
   - Based on the analysis, make informed decisions to enhance the content strategy.

8. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continuously monitor the performance and adjust as necessary.


## KPI Dashboard

> The Key Performance Indicator dashboard is a visual tool used to display and track critical business metrics, providing quick overviews of the performance of various aspects of a business. Key features often include:

- **Visual Representations**: Charts, graphs, and gauges to show data trends and performance.
- **Real-Time Data**: Up-to-date information for timely decision-making.
- **Customizable Views**: Tailored to show the most relevant KPIs for specific roles or departments.
- **Comparative Metrics**: Ability to compare current performance against targets, benchmarks, or historical data.

### Trend Analysis

> Trend analysis involves examining data points collected over time to identify patterns or trends.

- **Identify Patterns**: Recognize consistent movements in data over a period.
- **Forecast Future Performance**: Predict future outcomes based on historical data trends.
- **Highlight Anomalies**: Detect outliers or unusual spikes/drops in performance.
- **Support Strategic Planning**: Inform decision-making by understanding long-term performance trends.

### Time Series Analysis

> Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with data collected at specific intervals over time. It is used to:

- **Analyse Temporal Data**: Examine data points that are time-dependent.
- **Model Data**: Use mathematical (or ML) models to understand the underlying patterns.
- **Forecasting**: Predict future values based on historical data (similar to trend analysis but often more detailed).
- **Seasonal and Cyclical Patterns**: Identify and analyze regular patterns that occur within a specific timeframe.

When integrated into a KPI dashboard, these enable businesses to:

- **Monitor Performance**: See how KPIs evolve, identify long-term trends, and make informed decisions.
- **Set and Track Goals**: Establish realistic targets based on historical trends and monitor progress towards these goals.
- **Enhance Reporting**: Provide clear, visual representations of performance data to stakeholders.

### A/B Testing

> A/B testing (or split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of an item (like a product or webpage) to determine which one performs better. The general procedure includes:

1. **Define the Objective**: (as usual)
2. **Create Variants**:
   - **Version A (Control)**: The original version.
   - **Version B (Variant)**: The modified version with the changes you want to test.
3. **Randomized Assignment**:
   - Randomly assign users to either the control group or the variant group to ensure unbiased results.
4. **Run the Test**:
   - Present the different versions to users simultaneously to collect data over a specified period.
5. **Collect Data**:
   - Monitor key metrics to gather performance data from both versions.
6. **Analyse Results**:
   - Use statistical methods to compare the performance of the control and variant groups. Determine if the differences observed are statistically significant.

### Monitoring Key Metrics

> Monitoring key metrics involves tracking specific indicators that reflect the performance and impact of changes over time. The general procedure includes:

1. **Identify Key Metrics**:
   - Determine the most relevant metrics to monitor based on your objectives (e.g., sales, user engagement, customer satisfaction through content analysis).
2. **Set Benchmarks**:
   - Establish baseline performance levels or benchmarks to compare against future data.
3. **Continuous Tracking**:
   - Use tools like KPI dashboards to continuously monitor these metrics in real-time or at regular intervals.
4. **Analyse Trends**:
   - Perform trend analysis and time series analysis to identify patterns and understand how metrics evolve over time.
5. **Compare Against Targets**:
   - Regularly compare current performance against predefined targets or benchmarks to assess progress.

Use the insights gained from A/B testing and monitoring to make data-driven decisions. If a change shows positive results, consider implementing it widely. If not, use the feedback to iterate and improve.
